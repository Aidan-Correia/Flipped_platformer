# Flipped_platformer
My proof of concept for a very unique 2D platformer.

The basic premise is that the whole world is black and white, black being the foreground and white being the background. The player has the ability to "flip" through the foreground, inverting gravity, inverting the color of the players sprite, and flipping the sprite upside down.

All sprites/code/audio written and designed by me (sound made in jsfxr, a free online 8-bit sound generator). The codebase was heavily inspired by Maddy Thorsons "Towerfall" (and later Celeste), which can be found here: https://maddythorson.medium.com/celeste-and-towerfall-physics-d24bd2ae0fc5

NOTE: I built this as a proof of concept, hence the codebase is outrageously disorganized. I did not architect the game very well, and the spaghetti code quickly spun out of control as I made all the features I needed functional with complete disregard for how annoying it would be to build upon in the future.
