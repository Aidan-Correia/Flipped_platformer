# Flipped_platformer
My proof of concept for a very unique 2D platformer.

The basic premise is that the whole world is black and white, black being the foreground and white being the background. The player has the ability to "flip" through the foreground, inverting gravity, inverting the color of the players sprite, and flipping the sprite upside down.

All sprites/code/audio written and designed by me (sound made in jsfxr, a free online 8-bit sound generator). The codebase was heavily inspired by Maddy Thorsons "Towerfall" (and later Celeste), which can be found here: https://maddythorson.medium.com/celeste-and-towerfall-physics-d24bd2ae0fc5

NOTE: I built this as a proof of concept, I was only concerned with getting the necessary features shipped for demonstration. As a result, the codebase is extremely messy, and would take hours to refactor if I were to continue development (or I could go full Toby Fox and double down on the spaghetti code, but either way it is not worth it at the moment).

If someone wants to steal this idea and make a full game out of it, please be my guest. I don't know if I'll ever come back to this, and I think it could be really, really cool if executed well.
